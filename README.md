## Introduction 
**Hi there!** Welcome to Fiona’s collection of climate models — a little space where I share models I’ve built out of curiosity and fun.
Some are inspired by existing tools and resources, while others are drafted from scratch based on core equations. A few may still be under construction or not fully functional (yet!), but I’ll keep updating things as I go.
Feel free to reach out if you’re interested or have questions — always happy to chat! :)
